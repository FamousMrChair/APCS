/*** 
 *  DISCO:
 * 
 *  - Its interesting that if you use the wrong values for a, b, and c the algorithm is not going to work.
 *  - Fred seemed pretty excited today! Didn't see a lot of George, though.
 * 
 *  QCC:
 * 
 *  - Is the point of the Mysterion to be an extremely fast sorter?
 *  - At what point does using this algorithm becomes useless?
 * 
 *  q0: What does it do?
 * 
 *  The Mysterion is an algorithm which takes in an array, and then sorts the array based on whether the values in the array are greater than
 *  arr[c], or lower than arr[c].
 * 
 *  q1: What is its Big-Oh runtime?
 * 
 *  The Big O notation of the Mysterion Algorithm is O(n).
