    <p> 0) When you are writing a number in a base-x number system, you express it in as the sum of the powers of that base. The base determines the number of digits that are available in the number. For example, a number in base 2 number system will only have 2 digits available for it, 0 and 1. This continues until base 11, where the same principle applies, but since we only have 10 digits in our number system, we then proceed to use letters such as A for bases 11 and up. In addition, the smallest base possible is base 2 because there is no way to express a number in base 1 or base 0.w A number expressed in a smaller base will most certainly have more digits than the number expressed in a larger base, since each digit is representative of the base to the power based on the position of the digit. Smaller bases will require more digits to add up to the same sum if larger bases were used. 
1) Binary is a series of zeros and ones and it is a base 2 number system. Binary is important because computers only process binary numbers. Computers process information differently from humans, and at the lowest level of a computer application, the computer is essentially asking for an input of yes or no. Binary presents a string of yes or no to different queries from the computer, allowing the computer to process larger bits of information by breaking it down. The binary number system is used all around the digital world, and an important example of this is bit encryption. In an encryption algorithm, the computer or program asks for a bit key, a binary number in varying lengths. A bit key is processed by the computer and is then used to decrpt a data file. This process is extremely secure because the possibilites for a 128-bit or 256-bit (2^128 and 2^256 outcomes) is so insanely high that it's virtually impossible to guess the key.
2) 1. Assign a value n for every digit of the binary. The right-most digit starts with an n value of 0, increasing by 1 towards the left. 
2. Take the value of each digit and multiply it by 2^n
3. Add up each value

3) 1. Divide number by 2
2. Record down remainder
3. Repeat step 1 and 2 while number > 0
4. Take the reverse of all of the remainders. <p>
