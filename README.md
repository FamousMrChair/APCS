    <p> 0) When you are writing a number in a base-x number system, you express it in as the summation of the powers of that base.

1) Binary is important because computers only process binary numbers. Binary is a series of zeros and ones and it is a base 2 number system. Since computers can only process a yes or no condition, binary helps to provide that condition, for example if the switch is turned off or on.
2) 1. Assign a value n for every digit of the binary. The right-most digit starts with an n value of 0, increasing by 1 towards the left. 
2. Take the value of each digit and multiply it by 2^n
3. Add up each value

3) 1. Divide number by 2
2. Record down remainder
3. Repeat step 1 and 2 while number > 0
4. Take the reverse of all of the remainders. <p>
