DISCO:

Outsourcing is a lot less taxing on resources and allows for optimization. 
In the experiment done in class today, we looked at how we can split a deck of cards into two parts and "outsource" these cards to two other entities, or thinkeren.
We discovered it's really hard to accomplish this task with Stuyvesant juniors and seniors because there is always at least one faulty machine that causes the program to fail.
However, if all machines worked properly, the task should have been accomplished in a smooth and efficient manner.


QCC: 

How to ensure that there are no faulty machines and the program is guaranteed to succeed?
Why can't we just outsource to some foreign company and have them do all the work for us?

Thinkeren Firmware:

Allowed to give, take, and give back sorted.
Everytime you receive one source of data, you split it into halves and outsource to two other thinkeren.
Exception to this rule is when you receive a sorted list (aka a list of one element)
When this exception happens, you give back the sorted list to the person who handed you the list.
Everytime you receive two sources of data, you merge the two sorted lists into one sorted list using the following algorithm:

Take the first element of each set of data and compare the two. Take the least of the two elements and put it at the front of your new list.
Repeat this process until one of your two original lists run out, and then just append the rest of the remaining original list onto your new list.

Hand the sorted list back to the person who gave you one list originally.
