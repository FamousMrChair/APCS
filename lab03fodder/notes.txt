At the beginning of the method, we find the current time, set it as a new variable.
At the end of the method, we find the time.
Save time as an array?
Take the difference of the two times and set that as our new time variable, and now
we have recorded the time the method took to find the target.

Our hypothesis:

Binary search will take less time than linear search because binary search will take less
"guesses". This is because linear search takes the most extreme indexes (the first or the last one)
and iterates through the entire array, wasting a lot of time. Binary search looks for the middle guesses,
which can also be asserted as the "savviest" guess because it eliminates half of the options for each guess.

How we plan to test:

Test for amount of time linear search takes vs binary search for arrays with varying sizes.
All targets will be completely randomized to account for probability of having the best and worst case scenarios
for linear search.
We run a lot of tests: different arrays with differing array lengths as well as different targets across multiple test cases
for a single array.
