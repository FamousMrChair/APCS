Activity 2

1. A deck is a list of individual cards, almost like how a herd is a group of animals.
2. The deck contains 6 elements because there will be a different suitfor every single rank value, and since there are 3 rank values and 2 suits,
there will be 6 total card elements.
3. Ranks = two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jacks, queen, king, ace.
 Suits = spades, hearts, clover, diamond.
 PointValue = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11
 4.The order of the ranks and pointvalue array matters because we need to pair the pointvalues to the right rank cards as they are matched together
 by their position in their respective arrays.
